                        You’re checking this page, which means you might want to know a bit about me. Well, you came to the right place so let’s talk about <b>me</b> then.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve already mentioned this but just in case you missed it — I’m a developer, mostly working on that web stuff you hear so much about. And yeah, I write code for a living, fun eh? Not much but it’s enjoyable at times (more often when I’m not stressed out finding and squashing bugs).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Still curious about me? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Uhm.. I’m a Virgo?</i> Just kidding &#128514; read more below.

                    <p>
                        Did I bring it up already? I love startups and its ecosystem, I never imagined before that problems can be solved with wonderful ideas that can be built and executed upon if you’re ballsy enough. I know some that hate that grind, they say it pays cheap and forces you to become a <i>generalist</i> or a <i>master of none</i> ; which can be both true and can’t be denied. But hey, I’m not the one missing out on meeting awesome people and working on amazing products.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I guess it’s just a <i>matter of perspective</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You might be wondering why I seem obsessed with startups, well it’s because when I discovered about it, I realized something, you can achieve your dreams by simply <i>working towards it</i>. The fact that this industry is about making <i>decisions</i>, <i>sacrifices</i>, and <i>things happen</i> is just straightforward for me. Like in our actual lives, we make a choice then there’s a probable result. You leave something behind as a trade-off for anything better. You work to make ends meet and to build a place you can later call home. That’s how I see a startup, it’s like life, challenging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So if you’re reading this and curious where I’m working right now, well you guessed it right  —  probably in a startup.

                    <p>
                        Well I’m an average fellow when it comes to having fun. I did not have a lot of options or let’s just say I didn’t checked up on other choices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, I love gaming, it’s just a part of me now but not as competitive as I was. I just play games now for what they’re supposed to be for: <b>fun</b>. I started when I was still in grade school and spent almost half of my adolescence in <i>computer shops</i> since I did not have my own PC back then. Here are some of the games that I played or still playing: 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>RAN Online</i>, <i>Gunbound</i>, <i>Battle Realms</i>, <i>Command and Conquer</i> (Red Alert and Generals), <i>Warcraft III and its variety of custom maps</i> (including the early iterations of DoTA), <i>Counter Strike</i> (Source when I was still in college then moved on to Global Offensive), <i>League of Legends</i>, <i>DoTA 2</i> (when League’s just too toxic), <i>Path of Exile</i>, <i>Civilization 6</i>, <i>StarCraft 2</i> (when it became free) and a whole lot more to mention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, how do I stay productive when my hobby’s gaming you say? Well.. I read and write too which results to me being pumped up after scanning through walls of text. I’m not a bookworm, not in any way, I’ve read a bunch of <i>almanacs</i>, <i>encyclopedias</i>, and a good chunk of <i>Goosebumps</i> when I was younger but that’s it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays, I mostly consume <i>manga</i>, online blogs (both tech and self-improvement), write-ups, product and design case-studies, random <i>Reddit</i> content, <i>Hacker News</i> (just the <i>ask</i> section), and a bunch of online technical documentations when I’m working or building stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And yeah, I did say that I <a href="https://blog.nardsparagas.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" class="link">write</a> too. Sharing knowledge is fun for me. So there's that.
